This repository comprises audio and MIDI files composed by the author and Physarum polycephalum for the song called 'Creep into my Lawn'. 

If you use any audio or MIDI files in your research, please cite the paper as the following:

The MIDI files generated by Physarum are not quantised because they were converted to the time domain. Therefore, there will be shifts from the tempo grid. The 'original' and 'modified' MIDI files are quantised.
